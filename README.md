Code and files corresponding to Chertow, Gordon, Hirsch and Ramaswami (2019): Industrial symbiosis potential and urban infrastructure capacity in Mysuru, India

The files and code here show how to replicate the analysis in 'Industrial symbiosis potential and urban infrastructure capacity in Mysuru, India', an open access article that can be found here:
https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ab20ed

To cite the code, please cite the article: Marian Chertow et al 2019 Environ. Res. Lett. 14 075003

Analysis done in python using Jupyter notebooks. Start with Symbiosis_Potential_public.ipynb which gives step by step instructions for replicating the analysis.  

The other files, which are necessary inputs to the analysis, document our assumptions.
